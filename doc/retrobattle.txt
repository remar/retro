1. OVERVIEW

Retrobattle is a simple NES-style platform jumper where your objective
is to collect the 8 golden coins found in each level. There are
increasingly more difficult enemies to encounter, and they move faster
in later levels.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. BLOCKS

There are a couple of different kinds of blocks.

o Background blocks
o Solid blocks
o Breakable blocks

The background blocks are either blue or orange, on normal and bonus
levels respectively. These blocks can be found around the edges of the
playing field.

The solid blocks are blocks in the level that can't be destroyed in
any way. There are eight different colors of the solid blocks, one
color per four levels. There are 16 representations of a solid block,
depending on if there are block above, under, to the left, and to the
right of the block.

Breakable blocks are similar in many ways to solid blocks. The main
difference is of course that they can be destroyed by being hit by
shots from Captain Good and the Bounty Hunter, and by Drones that
randomly hit them. On higher difficulty levels (4 or above) the
breakable blocks takes two hits before being destroyed, which is
represented with cracked blocks.

If a block wants to respawn but is obstructed by anything at all,
it will wait one second before trying again.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. CAPTAIN GOOD

Captain Good is the name of the player character, and is represented
by a small sprite, 16x24 pixles. Captain Good can walk left and right,
shoot his trusty blaster, and jump with his jetpack. When in the air,
Captain Good moves either up or down with constant speed, using his
jetpack to assure that he doesn't just fall down! The blaster holds 8
rounds of ammunition which refills automatically, but with a
delay of 8 seconds. The blaster shots can damage breakable blocks and all
kinds of enemies. Captain Good can also pick up Power-Ups which appear
randomly in the levels.

If you walk left and suddenly hold right, Captain Good will walk
right, but continue left as soon as the right arrow is released (and
vice versa). This makes it easier to "twitch-turn around" to fire
behind you very quickly. Basically, if both the left and right arrow
keys are pressed at once, the one pressed last determines Captain
Good's direction.

At the start of a level, Good is nonsolid (blinking). As soon as the
key for left, right, jump or shoot is pressed, Good solidifies and can
be damaged. Pausing the game does not solidify him.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. ENEMIES

There are 8 kinds of enemies in Retrobattle.

1. Fuzz
2. Drone
3. Space Viper
4. Bounty Hunter
5. Red Fuzz
6. Gold Drone
7. Dire Space Viper
8. Dark Bounty Hunter


Fuzz
----
A Fuzz is a blue saw blade shaped cute little enemy that rolls around
on the terrain found in the levels. Fuzz spawn out of Nests that are
found in the levels every 8 seconds, as long as the number of Fuzz is
smaller than the maximum allowed. At the start of a level, the delay
between spawning Fuzz is only one second. A Fuzz starts to either move
left or right, and then moves in that direction until one of several
things happen: Fuzz shot, Fuzz in air, Fuzz colliding with bottom
(spikes).

If a Fuzz is shot, it becomes paralyzed and turns into a paler shade
of blue. When a Fuzz is paralyzed, it can be pushed down, and if it
drops far enough it will be destroyed and points will be awarded. If
the Fuzz recovers from paralyzation (happens after a set number of
seconds) it will start rolling again in the direction it had before
being shot.

If a Fuzz happens to be in the air (if the block that it's climbing
disappears) it will start falling down, just as if it were spawned out
of a Nest. When it lands, it will continue rolling in the direction
which it was rolling in before it fell down.

If a Fuzz collides with the spikes found at the bottom of the stage,
it reverses direction and climbs back up again the way it came.

Fuzz move at 120 pixels per second.


Drone
-----
A Drone is a gray, pointy enemy that moves around randomly
horizontally and vertically. The probability that a Drone moves in a
specific direction depends on the surrounding blocks/empty spaces. If
all surrounding tiles are empty, the drone moves with equal
probability in all directions. The probability that a Drone moves
through a breakable block is smaller than that it moves through empty
space, however it will always dig its way out if surrounded on all sides.
Drones have 2 hit points.

Drones do not dig unless Captain Good has solidified. Drones move at
60 pixels per second.


Space Viper
-----------

Space Vipers are long, green snakes that randomly prowl the field,
hiding behind all other objects and taking 6 hits directly to the head
to destroy. The only time they will break a block is when they get
surrounded by blocks in all directions, at which point they choose a
random way out. There is only ever one Viper per level, and the length
of their bodies depends on the Skill.

Vipers cannot pass through their own body - if a Viper heads into a
dead-end or is surrounded by its own body, it stops and waits until an
exit opens up. This means the Viper can coil itself up, and once it
starts moving again, its tail will stop where it coiled up until the
viper is at full length again.

Touching any part of the Viper means death. However, Captain Good can
fit vertically between two parts of a Viper.

Vipers move at 60 pixels per second.


Bounty Hunter
-------------

Bounty Hunters appear at random, flash for one second, then solidify
and wait another second, then fire their weapon and take another
second to fade away. They always face Captain Good, but can only fire
directly left or right.

Bounty Hunters have 4 hit points. When destroyed, they cause a 3*3
explosion that is harmless to Captain Good, but deals 2 damage to
other enemies. Bounty Hunters spend ceil(random(3)) seconds invisible
(after fading out and before fading in).

Bounty Hunters do not appear unless Captain Good has solidified.


Red Fuzz
--------

Just as fast as the blue ones, but randomize their direction every
random(3)+3 seconds.


Gold Drone
----------

The Gold version of the Drone has a 50% chance of moving towards
Captain Good, instead of simply moving at random; in this case it will
treat breakable blocks like empty space and smash right through.

Moving towards Captain Good means that the Drone will randomly either
head towards Good's X position, or his Y position.

Gold Drones do not dig unless Captain Good has solidified.


Dire Space Viper
----------------

These purple Vipers have a 50% chance to move towards Captain Good,
but not until he has solidified.

Moving towards Captain Good means that the Viper will randomly either
head towards Good's X position, or his Y position.


Dark Bounty Hunter
------------------

These Hunters sport blasters that cause Dark explosions exactly inside
of the block the bullet hits, and all four directions around the
block. Dark explosions only damage blocks and Captain Good. Dark
Bounty Hunters only spend 1/3 of a second invisible (after fading out
and before fading in). They do not appear unless Captain Good has
solidified.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. SKILL LEVELS

There are 8 skill levels in the game, which affect the color of the
blocks on the playing field and the enemies encountered. Choosing a
higher Skill than 1 also affects what bonus level is encountered
first.

The skill is increased after each bonus level.

At all Skills 4 and above, breakable blocks take 2 hits, but this does
not affect how enemies dig through them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. BONUS PICK-UPS

Bonuses appear randomly on the screen every random(33)+7 seconds,
though this timer does not count while Captain Good has not
solidified. Bonuses can only appear where there is a solid or
breakable block underneath, and cannot appear inside of anything at
all. All bonuses have a certain weight written in paranthesis that
determines how likely it is that they will appear.

1. SMALL COINS (3)
Gives 200 bonus points.

2. DIAMOND (3)
Gives 250 bonus points.

3. GOLD BAR (3)
Gives 300 bonus points.

4. BLUE PEARL (3)
Gives 400 bonus points.

5. WHITE BALL (2)
Refills all the ammunition for your standard gun.

6. LOCK (2)
Locks all the Fuzz Nests for 50 seconds, so that no new Fuzz can
appear. The only drawback is that you won't get as much score as you
normally would, as there will be less Fuzz to defeat.

7. POWER GUN (2)
This weapon temporarily replaces your standard gun, and the word POWER
appears in the upper right corner of the screen. It only has one shot,
so you lose the Power gun when you fire it. When the shot hits
something, it causes a huge 5*5 diamond explosion that destroys blocks
and deals 2 points of damage to all enemies caught in it. Note that
the explosion aligns itself to the grid of blocks on the playing field.

8. LASER GUN (2)
Like the Power gun, this weapon only has one shot, and disappears when
you use it. When you possess it, the word LASER appears in the upper
right corner of the screen. It fires a searing laser blast that cuts
straight through blocks and deals 2 points of damage to all enemies
caught in the line of fire. Note that the laser blast aligns itself to
the grid of blocks on the playing field; this means that it will only
cut through one horizontal line of blocks, never two.

9. CLOCK (1)
Adds 50 additional seconds to the timer.

10. BOMB (1)
Instantly stuns all Fuzz, destroys all Drones and deals 2 points of
damage to the Space Viper and Bounty Hunter (unless it's busy
teleporting). If a Fuzz is just about to jump out of a nest when the
bomb detonates, the Fuzz will not appear.

11. QUAKE (1)
Damages all undamaged blocks on the screen. It doesn't destroy the
blocks that are already damaged. Only appears on Skill 4 and higher.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. SCORE TALLY SCREEN

When the last coin has been collected, all objects disappear, a tune
is played and the screen then wipes down to the score tally screen. If
all lives are lost, you also enter this screen, but with no tune being
played. The scoreboard counts up all the bonuses in order, with a
short delay between each. Time units (seconds) remaining count down
instead of up.

Time: 20 for each second
Coins: 100*Skill level (Bonus levels are different)
Fuzz/Red Fuzz: 120
Drones/Gold Drones: 200
Space Viper/Dire Space Viper: 1200
Bounty Hunter/Dark Bounty Hunter: 1000

The time bonus is not awarded if the timer ever ran out during the
level or if all lives were lost. In this case the text "NO BONUS" is
displayed instead of the usual text for counting the time points.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. LEVEL SPECIFICATION

A level file consists of an array of 25 * 15 numbers. The following is
the specification of what the numbers mean:

  0: Empty
  1: Breakable
  2: Solid
  3: Captain Good
  4: Fuzz Nest
  5: Golden Coin

Here's an example level (#1):

2 2 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 2 2
2 2 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 2
2 2 0 0 2 1 2 0 0 4 0 1 1 1 0 4 0 0 2 1 2 0 0 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1 2 2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. BONUS LEVELS

Bonus levels appear for every 4 levels beaten. There is one bonus
level for every Skill level; after the 8th bonus level is beaten, they
start over from the first one.

You have 60 seconds to get all 10 coins in a bonus level. There are no
enemies and no ammo limit.

Coins are worth 200+(100*Bonus level, NOT Skill level). If all coins
are collected before time runs out, the stage ends and you get a 2000
point bonus.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. SCORE COUNTING

Score is usually only added to your total at the score tally screen,
however collecting certain bonuses immediately increases your
score. Any time the score passes a multiple of 30000 in the game (and
all lives are not lost), you get an extra life. This stops working
after a score of 240000, at which point you've earned 8 extra lives.
