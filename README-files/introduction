 . Introduction

   Retrobattle is made to look and feel like the classic arcade-style
   NES games, such as Ice Climber and Clu Clu Land. Not only are the
   sprites limited to three colors each, but the scoring, increasing
   difficulty, and setup of the game makes for a challenging arcade
   experience that mixes various oldschool concepts.
